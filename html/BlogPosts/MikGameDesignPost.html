        <h2>The Game Design of Mik</h2>
        <p> <i>Heya!</i>  <br>
            In this Blog Post I´ll start talking a bit about the Design behind Mik.
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Theme</h3>
        <p>As it might be obvious, Mik is very inspired by Portal 1 and a Portal 2. The idea for the game was to combine Portal 1 and Portal 2 with popular movement Mechanics like wall running
        and grappling. An important part of the game should be the total isolation of the player. The player shouldn´t have contact with anybody or anything. No humans, no Robots, only an automated warning system
        used for explaining some of the game mechanics & dumping lore. But even this single voice that speaks with you from time to time slowly fades away as you traverse more and more broken areas of the facility and rooms where you shouldn´t even be in.
            <br>
            <br>
            A lot of the areas and rooms which the player explores are simply not meant to be seen by the likes of a Test Subject. The Player is not meant to be there. He was originally intended to complete the testing tracks and gather data for the development
            of Robots, and while there are some that you traverse, there are just as many maintenance rooms, offices and garbage dumps that can be found.
            <br>
            Adding to the whole scary factor, there are random background sounds being played from time to time and sometimes you can find abandoned hideouts, camps etc showing that there were people living here even after whatever happened to the facility.
